# Changelog

All notable changes will be documented here once Voyalier begins publishing releases.

The project follows Semantic Versioning and keeps unreleased work under the section below.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial repository, product, architecture, security, web, API, desktop, documentation, and delivery foundations.
- Added the Phase 1 local core: SQLite-backed app services, deterministic confirmation parsers, contract schema drift tests, HTTP endpoints, and direct Tauri IPC command tests.

### Changed

- Rebuilt the brand identity around the folded-route mark (one strip, one fold, one vermilion waypoint), replacing the Wayline V: new mark/lockup/app-icon assets, washi–sumi–indigo–vermilion design tokens, Zen Kaku Gothic New and Shippori Mincho type, a redesigned animated landing page, and a matching README and docs theme.
- Reworked desktop transport to direct Tauri IPC with no fixed loopback listener in the desktop crate.
